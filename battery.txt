1. Active Mode (AM)

    The CPU is fully running.
    Peripherals and clocks are active.
    Highest power consumption.

2. Low-Power Mode 0 (LPM0)

    The CPU is halted.
    The MCLK (Main Clock) is disabled, but SMCLK (Sub-Main Clock) and ACLK (Auxiliary Clock) remain active.
    Peripherals can continue to operate.

3. Low-Power Mode 1 (LPM1)

    Similar to LPM0, but DCO (Digitally Controlled Oscillator) is disabled.
    Reduced power consumption.

4. Low-Power Mode 2 (LPM2)

    The CPU is halted.
    MCLK and SMCLK are disabled.
    Only ACLK remains active.

5. Low-Power Mode 3 (LPM3)

    Similar to LPM2, but the DCO and DC Generator are also disabled.
    Very low power consumption.

6. Low-Power Mode 4 (LPM4)

    The system is in a deep sleep mode.
    CPU, clocks, and most peripherals are turned off.
    Only external interrupts (e.g., GPIO wakeup) can wake the CPU.
